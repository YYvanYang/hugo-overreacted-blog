# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using the Hugo Overreacted template. The template is designed to be minimalist and focused on content readability, just like the original overreacted.io blog.

## Features

The template includes:

- Clean, minimalist design
- Dark/light theme switching
- Syntax highlighting
- Responsive layout
- SEO optimization

## Getting Started

To create a new post, simply run:

```bash
hugo new posts/my-new-post.md
```

Then edit the markdown file and publish when ready!

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greetReader(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! Welcome to the blog.`);
}

greetReader("World");
```

Thanks for reading!
