# Accessibility Testing and Validation

This post serves as a comprehensive test for accessibility features in our Hugo blog template, ensuring WCAG 2.1 compliance and excellent user experience for all users.

## Skip Navigation Testing

The template includes a "Skip to main content" link that should be visible when focused. Test this by:

1. **Tab navigation**: Press Tab when the page loads
2. **Keyboard activation**: Press Enter or Space to skip to main content
3. **Focus management**: Verify focus moves to the main content area

## Heading Structure and Hierarchy

Proper heading structure is crucial for screen readers and navigation:

### Level 3: Navigation Landmarks
#### Level 4: Content Sections
##### Level 5: Subsections
###### Level 6: Details

Screen readers should be able to navigate through this hierarchy easily using heading navigation commands.

## Keyboard Navigation Testing

All interactive elements should be accessible via keyboard:

### Links and Navigation

- [Internal link to home page](/) - Should be focusable with Tab
- [External link to WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) - Opens in new tab with proper attributes
- [Email link](mailto:test@example.com) - Should trigger email client

### Focus Indicators

When navigating with Tab key, all focusable elements should display visible focus indicators:

```css
/* Focus indicator styles */
:focus {
  outline: 2px solid var(--color-link);
  outline-offset: 2px;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
}

/* Enhanced focus for interactive elements */
a:focus,
button:focus {
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(210, 54, 105, 0.3);
}
```

## Color Contrast Testing

The template uses theme-aware colors that maintain proper contrast ratios:

### Light Theme Colors
- **Background**: #ffffff (white)
- **Text**: #282c35 (dark gray) - Contrast ratio: 12.6:1 ✅
- **Headings**: #000000 (black) - Contrast ratio: 21:1 ✅
- **Links**: #d23669 (pink) - Contrast ratio: 4.7:1 ✅

### Dark Theme Colors
- **Background**: #282c35 (dark gray)
- **Text**: #dcdfe4 (light gray) - Contrast ratio: 11.8:1 ✅
- **Headings**: #ffffff (white) - Contrast ratio: 12.6:1 ✅
- **Links**: #ff6b9d (light pink) - Contrast ratio: 4.9:1 ✅

All color combinations exceed WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).

## Screen Reader Testing

Content should be properly announced by screen readers:

### Semantic HTML Structure

```html
<article role="article" aria-labelledby="post-title">
  <header>
    <h1 id="post-title">Post Title</h1>
    <time datetime="2025-01-24T11:30:00Z">January 24, 2025</time>
  </header>
  
  <main role="main">
    <p>Post content...</p>
  </main>
  
  <footer>
    <nav aria-label="Post navigation">
      <!-- Navigation links -->
    </nav>
  </footer>
</article>
```

### ARIA Labels and Descriptions

Interactive elements include proper ARIA attributes:

- **Theme toggle button**: `aria-label="Toggle dark/light theme"`
- **Navigation menu**: `aria-label="Main navigation"`
- **Skip link**: `aria-label="Skip to main content"`

## Image Accessibility

All images should include descriptive alt text:

*Figure 1: Accessibility testing flow diagram showing the relationship between keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader compatibility.*

## Form Accessibility (if applicable)

When forms are present, they should include:

```html
<form role="form" aria-labelledby="contact-form-title">
  <h2 id="contact-form-title">Contact Form</h2>
  
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="name">Name (required)</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required 
           aria-describedby="name-help" aria-invalid="false">
    <div id="name-help" class="help-text">Enter your full name</div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="email">Email (required)</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required 
           aria-describedby="email-help" aria-invalid="false">
    <div id="email-help" class="help-text">We'll never share your email</div>
  </div>
  
  <button type="submit" aria-describedby="submit-help">
    Send Message
  </button>
  <div id="submit-help" class="help-text">
    Press Enter or click to submit the form
  </div>
</form>
```

## Theme Switching Accessibility

The theme toggle should be accessible:

1. **Keyboard activation**: Space or Enter key should toggle theme
2. **Screen reader announcement**: State changes should be announced
3. **Visual feedback**: Focus indicator should be visible
4. **Persistent preference**: Choice should be remembered

## Manual Testing Procedures

### Keyboard-Only Navigation Test

3. Verify all functionality is accessible
4. Check focus indicators are always visible

### Screen Reader Test
1. Enable screen reader (VoiceOver on Mac, NVDA on Windows)
2. Navigate through content using screen reader commands
3. Verify all content is properly announced
4. Test heading navigation and landmark jumping

### High Contrast Mode Test

## Conclusion

Accessibility testing ensures our Hugo blog template is usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or the assistive technologies they use. Regular testing with both automated tools and manual procedures helps maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and provides an excellent user experience for all visitors.

Remember: Accessibility is not a one-time feature—it's an ongoing commitment to inclusive design.
