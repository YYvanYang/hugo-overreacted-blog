# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to fix critical deployment test failures in the Hugo blog template to ensure it meets modern web standards, SEO best practices, and security requirements. The fixes will address missing meta tags, security headers, robots.txt configuration, and JavaScript asset loading issues identified during comprehensive deployment testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the site to display properly on mobile devices, so that I can read content comfortably on any screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page loads THEN the system SHALL include a viewport meta tag with proper mobile scaling configuration
2. WHEN the viewport meta tag is rendered THEN the system SHALL use "width=device-width, initial-scale=1" as the content value
3. WHEN pages are accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL prevent horizontal scrolling and ensure proper text scaling
4. WHEN responsive design is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain readability across all device sizes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a search engine crawler, I want to find proper meta descriptions and canonical URLs, so that I can index the content accurately and prevent duplicate content issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page is rendered THEN the system SHALL include a meta description tag with relevant content summary
2. WHEN meta descriptions are generated THEN the system SHALL use page-specific descriptions or fallback to site description
3. WHEN pages are served THEN the system SHALL include canonical URL meta tags to prevent duplicate content
4. WHEN canonical URLs are generated THEN the system SHALL use the absolute URL format with proper domain
5. WHEN meta descriptions are created THEN the system SHALL limit length to 155-160 characters for optimal SEO

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a search engine crawler, I want to access a robots.txt file, so that I can understand crawling permissions and sitemap locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN robots.txt is requested THEN the system SHALL serve a properly formatted robots.txt file
2. WHEN robots.txt is generated THEN the system SHALL include sitemap location reference
3. WHEN crawling rules are defined THEN the system SHALL specify appropriate User-agent directives
4. WHEN robots.txt is served THEN the system SHALL use proper content-type header (text/plain)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want JavaScript functionality to load properly, so that interactive features like theme switching work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are rendered THEN the system SHALL include proper script tags for JavaScript assets
2. WHEN JavaScript files are referenced THEN the system SHALL use Hugo's asset pipeline for proper linking
3. WHEN theme switching is available THEN the system SHALL load the theme-switcher.js file correctly
4. WHEN JavaScript assets are served THEN the system SHALL include integrity hashes for security
5. WHEN scripts are loaded THEN the system SHALL use appropriate loading strategies (defer/async)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the website to implement proper security headers, so that I'm protected from common web vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are served THEN the system SHALL include X-Frame-Options header to prevent clickjacking
2. WHEN content is delivered THEN the system SHALL include X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header
3. WHEN security is enforced THEN the system SHALL include Content-Security-Policy header with appropriate directives
4. WHEN HTTPS is used THEN the system SHALL include HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) header
5. WHEN security headers are configured THEN the system SHALL implement them at the Cloudflare Workers level

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing to validate all fixes, so that I can ensure the deployment meets all quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment tests run THEN the system SHALL pass all viewport meta tag validations
2. WHEN SEO tests execute THEN the system SHALL pass meta description and canonical URL checks
3. WHEN security tests run THEN the system SHALL pass all security header validations
4. WHEN asset tests execute THEN the system SHALL detect and validate JavaScript file loading
5. WHEN robots.txt tests run THEN the system SHALL successfully access and validate the robots.txt file
