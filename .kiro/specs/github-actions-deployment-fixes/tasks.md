# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix deployment job dependencies and trigger conditions
  - Remove the `needs: deploy_staging` dependency from `deploy_production` job
  - Update trigger conditions for both staging and production deployments to be mutually exclusive
  - Ensure both jobs only depend on the `build` job
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.3_

- [x] 2. Implement environment-aware build configuration logic
  - Update the build job to determine target environment from branch and manual inputs
  - Modify build script selection to use correct configuration for staging vs production
  - Add proper environment variable handling for production builds
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Create mutually exclusive deployment trigger conditions
  - Implement staging deployment triggers for develop branch and manual staging selection
  - Implement production deployment triggers for main branch and manual production selection
  - Ensure no overlap between staging and production deployment conditions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Test workflow changes with different trigger scenarios
  - Create test cases for develop branch push triggering only staging deployment
  - Create test cases for main branch push triggering only production deployment
  - Create test cases for manual dispatch to staging and production environments
  - Verify that deployments run independently without cross-dependencies
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.2, 5.3_
