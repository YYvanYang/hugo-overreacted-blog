# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to fix critical navigation issues in the Hugo blog template, specifically addressing dropdown menu functionality, mobile navigation, and theme switching. The current navigation system has several broken features that prevent users from properly navigating the site and accessing all available content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want to see dropdown menus when hovering over navigation items with children, so that I can access sub-navigation items like Documentation and Examples under Resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a navigation item with children THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown menu with all child items
2. WHEN a dropdown menu is displayed THEN the system SHALL show proper visual indicators (arrow rotation, background changes)
3. WHEN a user moves their mouse away from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL hide the dropdown after a brief delay
4. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN the system SHALL support focus-based dropdown activation
5. WHEN dropdown menus are shown THEN the system SHALL ensure proper z-index layering and positioning

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to tap the mobile menu toggle button to open and close the navigation menu, so that I can access all navigation items on small screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps the mobile menu toggle button THEN the system SHALL show/hide the mobile navigation menu
2. WHEN the mobile menu is opened THEN the system SHALL change the hamburger icon to a close (X) icon
3. WHEN the mobile menu is closed THEN the system SHALL change the close icon back to a hamburger icon
4. WHEN clicking outside the mobile menu THEN the system SHALL close the mobile menu automatically
5. WHEN pressing the Escape key THEN the system SHALL close the mobile menu and return focus to the toggle button

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click the theme toggle button to switch between light and dark modes, so that I can customize my reading experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the theme toggle button THEN the system SHALL switch between light and dark themes
2. WHEN the theme changes THEN the system SHALL update the button icon to reflect the current theme
3. WHEN theme switching occurs THEN the system SHALL persist the preference in localStorage
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL apply the user's saved theme preference or system default
5. WHEN themes change THEN the system SHALL update syntax highlighting stylesheets accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want all navigation interactions to work with keyboard navigation and screen readers, so that I can navigate the site using assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus indicators for all interactive elements
2. WHEN dropdown menus are activated THEN the system SHALL update ARIA attributes appropriately
3. WHEN mobile menu state changes THEN the system SHALL announce changes to screen readers
4. WHEN theme switching occurs THEN the system SHALL announce the new theme to screen readers
5. WHEN navigation elements receive focus THEN the system SHALL ensure sufficient color contrast and visibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the navigation JavaScript to be properly initialized and error-free, so that all interactive features work reliably across different browsers and devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL properly initialize all JavaScript event listeners
2. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking functionality
3. WHEN DOM elements are missing THEN the system SHALL check for element existence before attaching listeners
4. WHEN multiple theme switcher instances exist THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicts and duplicate initialization
5. WHEN browser compatibility issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallbacks
